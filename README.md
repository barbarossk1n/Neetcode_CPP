## ðŸ“‚ Topic: Arrays & Hashing  

The **Arrays & Hashing** category includes some of the most essential problems that often appear in technical interviews.  
Mastering these helps build a solid foundation for data manipulation and problem-solving.

### ðŸ“˜ Key Concepts

- **Arrays:**
  * Fast random access: `O(1)`
  * Insert/delete operations (except at the end): `O(n)`
  * Commonly used structure: `std::vector`

- **Hash Tables (Maps & Sets):**
  * Store key-value pairs for efficient lookups: `O(1)` average case
  * C++ tools: `unordered_map`, `unordered_set`
  * Useful for frequency counting, duplicate detection, etc.
 
- **Common Techniques:**
  * Frequency counters
  * Two pointers
  * Sorting + binary search
  * Hash sets for uniqueness checking
